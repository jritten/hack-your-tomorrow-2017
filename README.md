Casino Locale
"Instead of Feeling Bad About Spending, Feel Good About Saving"

Over 100 million American's visit casinos annually generating a revenue of over $60 billion. Nearly half of all casino goers are age 50 or older, and much of this profit comes from these older gamblers. Many older aduluts view the casino as a place to socialize with the community and escape from loneliness and grief. States with large populations of adults over 65, like Michigan, have increased access to casinos resulting in crippling debt and diminished quality of life.

In order to solve this problem for Americans over age 50 who live on a fixed income, we have developed Casino Locale, a web and mobile application built in Ruby on Rails to simulate both the game play and social aspect of a casino. US Bank customers can work with a person banker to setup a savings escrow account to maintain their monthly living expenses, while also having the ability to "purchase" game play tokens by transfering funds from their checking account into their savings. Instead of giving your money to the casinos, let's give our money back to ourselves to use within our 'locale' communities and gamify the way in which we approach saving for the future. Reward yourself for not throwing money away at the casino by building your savings account and preparing for your future.
